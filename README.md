# odin-recipes
First HTML project on Odin, a recipe website. 

In this project, I have learned to create an html boiler plate, learned the use of headers, paragraphs, anchors with linking through absolute and relative paths, image tags with source and alt attributes a homepage,ordered and unordered lists, to create a homepage and link other webpages to it, and commmit updates to github via the terminal.
