    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>This crockpot butter chicken is one of my favorite Indian dishes. My friend made this dish for my family, and we were head over heels! I don't think I've had butter chicken that I've liked more. It's wonderful to put it into the slow cooker in the morning and come home to the aroma of warm Indian spices... I love it! Serve with basmati rice and warm naan bread.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 large skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (6 oz) can tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 tbsp curry paste</li>
        <li>2 tsp curry powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp tandoori masala</li>
        <li>1 tsp garam masala</li>
        <li>15 green cardamom pods</li>
        <li>1 (14 oz) can coconut milk</li>
        <li>1 cup low-fat plain yogurt</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Warm butter and vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in chicken, onion, and garlic. Cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 10 minutes. Stir in tomato paste, curry paste, curry powder, tandoori masala, and garam masala until no lumps of tomato paste remain.</li>
        <li>Pour mixture into a slow cooker; stir in cardamom pods, coconut milk, and yogurt. Season with salt.</li>
        <li>Cook on High for 4 to 6 hours (or on Low for 6 to 8 hours) until chicken is tender and sauce has reduced to desired consistency. Remove and discard cardamom pods before serving.</li>
